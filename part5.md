# Introduction to OpenCV

### Introduction

OpenCV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection. In this tutorial, we explain how you can use OpenCV in your applications.

### Computer Vision

Computer Vision can be defined as a discipline that explains how to reconstruct, interrupt, and understand a 3D scene from its 2D images, in terms of the properties of the structure present in the scene. It deals with modeling and replicating human vision using computer software and hardware.

Computer Vision overlaps significantly with the following fields - 
* Image Processing 
* Pattern Recognition
* Photogrammetry

### Application of Computer Vision

**Robotics Application**
* Localization 
* Navigation
* Obstacle Avoidance
* Assembly
* Manipulation
* Human Robot Interaction (HRI)

**Medicine Application**
* Classification and detection (e.g. lesion or cells classification and tumor detection)
* 2D/3D segmentation
* 3D human organ reconstruction (MRI or ultrasound)
* Vision-guided robotics surgery

**Industrial Automation Application**
* Industrial inspection (defect detection)
* Assembly
* Barcode and package label reading
* Object sorting
* Document understanding (e.g. OCR)


**Security Application**
* Biometrics (iris, finger print, face recognition)
* Surveillance âˆ’ Detecting certain suspicious activities or behaviors

**Transportation Application**
* Autonomous vehicle
* Safety, e.g., driver vigilance monitoring
